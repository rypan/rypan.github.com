In November 2008, [Proposition 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8) was passed with a simple majority and added an article to the California Constitution which read “Only marriage between a man and woman is valid or recognized in California”.  A law was placed on the people that 7 million people wanted and 6.4 million fought against.

The practice that half of a population can dictate the course of a State or Country needs be strongly re-evaluated. 51% may be a majority, but it is not consensus. If we had 100 people, it means 49 are doing something for the other half. The marginally-winning team is dictating the rules.

Amendments and laws that change the livelihood of how we function and work need to be passed by a significant 2/3 majority. When you have 1/2 of a state or country disagreeing with a policy or decision, take it back to the drawing board.
