title: Why Vevo Will be a Hit

Right off the bat, I’ll say what everyone is thinking, it looks like Hulu. I agree. But that’s not a bad thing. By imitating the newest and hottest video property, [Vevo](http://www.vevo.com) has set themselves up for success.

Vevo has the support of the big record labels, so content will be there. It will be in its highest quality, and if [what Wired says](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/12/label-backed-vevo-video-site-launches-but-mtv-has-no-fear) is true, it will be the only source of those videos online. So if MTV wants to use the video on their site, they will be embedding a Vevo player.

The site iseasy to use and has a lot of room for new features and improvements. From day 1 they are showcasing full page ads, 15-second pre-rolling ads, and sponsorship links.  My hunch is Vevo will be able to monetize music videos far better than YouTube or MySpace through compelling ad opportunities.

Vevo has been given [liberal branding](http://www.youtube.com/vevo) on YouTube channel and video pages. That’s free attention. For example, the [Single Ladies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY) video by Beyonce has generated 72M views in the past 2 months. The engineering support from Google is priceless too. The partnership may look more valuable for Vevo, but Google has to be thrilled to be a big player in the room. Vevo could have easily gone the route of Hulu and created everything from scratch, on their own.

It’s only the first week, but I have high hopes for the music video destination.  I can easily see the site becoming a destination for artist bios, tour dates, ticket sales, digital downloads, and even merchandise. It’s the studios and artists collective way of making their own stamp on the web. Rather than being the participant, this time they are the creators of a new experience.
