title: Pipette and Rock Health
---

Jimmy and I are excited to be a part of [Rock Health](http://www.rockhealth.com), a seed accelerator for health care apps. We're thrilled for what the next 5 months have in store for us and our company. 

We originally created [Funnel](http://usefunnel.com) to be the easiest canvas for collecting information across all devices: desktops, smartphones, and tablets. We're proud of how far we've gotten today. Funnel is being used everywhere from Fortune 50s to small businesses. 

In joining Rock Health we are taking the next step. Our advisors, mentors, and closest friends always encouraged us to take what we've learned with Funnel and apply it to even harder and more meaningful problems. With our new product [Pipette](http://usepipette.com), we will be doing that: we're tackling health care.

With Pipette, we want to keep doctors and patients in sync. Unfortunately, doctors don't have much influence or control of patients once they leave the hospital or doctor's office. Using Pipette, doctors can monitor and educate patients throughout the course of their care, using smartphones and tablets to improve recovery and outcomes.

We have an idea on our hands that will improve and save lives. We have a lot to learn, and we are so glad the Rock Health mentors, partners and advisors are there to help us. Our team is going to bring a fresh perspective to an industry that is yearning for innovation.
